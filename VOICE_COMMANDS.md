**Response:** "Sorry, I didn't quite get that. Try asking for a sensor reading or say 'turn on pump'."

### Tips for Better Recognition:
- ✅ Speak clearly and at a normal pace
- ✅ Use simple, natural language
- ✅ Include the sensor name (e.g., "what's the soil moisture?")
- ✅ On mobile, hold the mic close to your mouth
- ❌ Avoid background noise
- ❌ Don't shout
